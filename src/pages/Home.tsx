            Forevercraft is a complete fantasy transformation of vanilla Minecraft — built over
            hundreds of hours, one function at a time. It doesn't replace the game you love.
            It gives it depth. A reason to keep mining after diamonds. A reason to fish in the rain.
            A reason to walk into a structure you've seen a hundred times and feel something new.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-stone-400">
            At its core is the{' '}
            <span className="text-yellow-500 font-semibold">Dream Rate</span> — a custom RNG
            system that connects every system. The artifacts you wear, the pets you raise, the
            constellations you complete, the time of day, even the phase of the moon — everything
            feeds into it. Start at zero. Reach for fifty. The world opens as you do.

        <FeatureSection title="Spirit Weapons">
          <p className="text-stone-300">
            14 legendary weapons — one for each class. Dropped at 5% from raid bosses at the bottom
            of every structure. They start at Common tier and progress through seven stages all the
            way to Spirit. Each has two triggerable abilities, passive effects, and a metamorphosis
            system with unique requirements per weapon.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-stone-400">
            Seven of them have twin forms — a second weapon revealed by the Dream Storm Crystal.
            Firebrand and Aqualoch. Hollow Fangs and Ghost Fang. Dragonheart and Johan Shield.
            When both twins are held, they unlock their true power.
          </p>
        </FeatureSection>

        <FeatureSection title="Companions">
          <p className="text-stone-300">
            106 companions, each one different. A Moldwarp that makes you mine faster.
            A Claude that detects ores through walls. A Butterfly whose Dream Weaver
            ability scales your luck up to +3.0 at max level. A Golden Dragon that
            wraps you in resistance and fire immunity just by existing.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-stone-400">
            Companions level from 1 to 100. Feed them, build a relationship, reach{' '}
            <span className="text-yellow-500 font-semibold">Eternal Bond</span> and every ability
            hits harder. 37 mythical companions can evolve into Ascended forms with unique abilities.
          </p>
        </FeatureSection>

        <FeatureSection title="The World">
          <p className="text-stone-300">
            Days last three times longer than vanilla. Four seasons cycle across a 64-day year,
            each bringing its own resource pack. World Events sweep across the land —
            Starfall Convergence, The Dreaming, Abyssal Tremor, Aurora Bloom, Rift Echo, and the
            Dimensional Rift — each with unique conditions and atmospheric warnings.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-stone-400">
            Night Terrors stalk players past Dream Rate 30. On new moon nights, a scaled mini-boss
            spawns nearby — glowing dark red, fire-resistant, hunting. The higher your Dream Rate,
            the more the world notices you.
          </p>
        </FeatureSection>

        <FeatureSection title="Classes & Combat">
          <p className="text-stone-300">
            14 weapon classes let you commit to a fighting style. Rogues dual-wield daggers with
            auto-swing and stealth kills. Berserkers trade armor for raw power with Rage mode.
            Archers overcharge past full draw. Beastlords turn tamed animals into a war pack.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-stone-400">
            Thirteen classes are known. The fourteenth... is not listed in any codex, not spoken
            of by any profession villager. Some say The Gatekeeper in the Stronghold knows
            something about it. Most dismiss this as rumor.
          </p>
        </FeatureSection>

        <FeatureSection title="Crate & Loot System">
          <p className="text-stone-300">
            Seven sources feed one unified crate engine: mining, fishing, harvesting, mob kills,
            structures, quests, and achievements. Each crate spawns as an animated barrel with
            tier-colored particles — the higher the tier, the longer the anticipation builds.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-stone-400">
            Structure crates are per-player with 50-hour refresh timers. 25 biome-specific
            treasure pools. Every crate has a 20% Awakening Stone drop for weapon mastery.
            Dream Echoes mark the exact spot where a Mythical was found — clickable, drifting,
            permanent markers of your greatest moments.
          </p>
        </FeatureSection>

        <FeatureSection title="Professions & Villages">
          <p className="text-stone-300">
            12 custom villager professions populate villages: Bartender, Wise Wanderer, Artificer,
            Retired Adventurer, Expeditionist, Spelunker, Apiarist, Archer, Technician, Zookeeper,
            Nymph, and a daily featured profession with bonus trades. Villagers are named based
            on their biome.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-stone-400">
            Villages have their own specialization system with upgrade paths. Build reputation
            from Stranger to Legend. Higher rep means better rewards, better prices, and Iron Golem
            allegiance. Place a Book and Quill in a village lectern to spawn the quest book — each
            village has its own. Betray a village and face exile. Above the quest book floats the
            Artifact Bounty Board and the Black Market barrel.
          </p>
        </FeatureSection>

        <FeatureSection title="Housing & Life Systems">
          <p className="text-stone-300">
            Place a Hearthstone (lodestone) to claim a 64-block zone as your home. Five upgrade
            tiers with buffs from Regeneration to Resistance I. Auto-garden crop growth. Comfort
            scoring at 25-block milestones. Quick Stash with labeled barrels and one-button
            inventory sorting.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-stone-400">
            The{' '}
            <span className="text-yellow-500 font-semibold">Patina system</span> tracks how long
            you've worn each artifact. Over time, a fresh artifact becomes Worn, then Seasoned,
            then Storied, and finally Legendary — each stage adding flavor text and a stat bonus.
            16 armor trim materials each have unique per-piece effects and full-set bonuses.
          </p>
        </FeatureSection>

        <FeatureSection title="Exploration & Discovery">
          <p className="text-stone-300">
            894 discoverable lore fragments forming 162 sets across 4 dimensions. A Lore Collection
            Map shows your progress — accessible through the Forevercraft Codex. Personal milestones
            replace the vanilla achievement system entirely, tracking your journey from first steps to
            Legend of Evercraft. A personal journal tracks every region you've explored.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-stone-400">
            Forage nodes and prospect nodes scatter across the world for hand-gathering resources.
            The Codex system is a 751-function interactive encyclopedia tracking every artifact you've
            found. The Bestiary catalogs every mob encounter. Guidestones create a craftable
            teleportation network across dimensions.
          </p>
        </FeatureSection>

        <FeatureSection title="Affinity & Morality">
          <p className="text-stone-300">
            Every class builds affinity through use — the more you fight with a weapon type,
            the stronger your alignment grows. Per-class affinity totals scale your damage
            through daily-capped progression across 7 stages.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-stone-400">
            The <span className="text-yellow-500 font-semibold">Reaper system</span> tracks
            your moral choices. Kill villagers and iron golems to build Infamy — the world
            sends hunting parties after you. Trade peacefully to build Renown — bandits
            target you for your reputation. Both decay over time. Neither path is permanent.
            Your choices shape how the world responds to you.
          </p>
        </FeatureSection>

        <FeatureSection title="Competitions & Trials">
          <p className="text-stone-300">
            Friendly competitions run daily — timed challenges with leaderboards, personal bests,
            and lifetime win tracking. Head-to-head challenges let you test your skills against
            other players in 1v1 format.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-stone-400">
            <span className="text-yellow-500 font-semibold">Craft Trials</span> offer 6 categories
            of timed challenges (Mining, Farming, Fishing, Building, Lumber, Artisan) with 10 tiers
            each. Daily challenges give free entry without a Dungeon Key. Hard mode halves the timer
            and applies Mining Fatigue. Master all 6 to earn Grand Master status.
