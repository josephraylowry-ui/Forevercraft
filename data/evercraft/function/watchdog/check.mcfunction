# Watchdog - Check and restart self-scheduling tick loops
# Called every ~5 seconds (100 ticks) from main tick
# Restarts any scheduled functions that may have broken
#
# IMPORTANT: Only include functions with intervals SHORTER than 5s (100 ticks) here!
# Minecraft's `schedule` uses `replace` mode by default. If the watchdog schedules a
# function for X ticks but X > 100, the watchdog will fire again before X elapses and
# push the timer forward — preventing the function from EVER running.
# Functions with intervals >= 5s that self-schedule don't need the watchdog at all.
#
# STAGGER: Schedules use tick offsets (not `1s`) to spread functions across different
# ticks within each interval. Without staggering, all 1s functions fire on the same
# tick (~29 functions, 1000+ commands/player), causing periodic lag spikes.
# The watchdog period (100t) is evenly divisible by all intervals (2t, 4t, 5t, 10t, 20t),
# so the stagger is perfectly maintained across watchdog cycles.
