# Set 5-minute cooldown (300 seconds, decremented every 20t in wolf_tick = 15000/20 = 750 cycles)
# Actually wolf_tick decrements by 1 per cycle (20t), so 300s = 15s per tick...
# Let's use raw seconds: 300 ticks at 1/sec decrement would need a 1s schedule
# Since wolf_tick runs every 20t and decrements by 1, we need 300s * 1 cycle/20t * 20t/s = 300
# wolf_tick runs every 20 ticks (1 second), decrement by 1 each time → 300 = 300 seconds
