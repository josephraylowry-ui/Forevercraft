# Evercraft Main Tick Function
# Runs every game tick for all evercraft systems

# Early exit if no players online
execute unless entity @a run return 0


# === SLOW DAYLIGHT: Advance DayTime by 1 every 3 real ticks ===
# gamerule minecraft:advance_time is false — we control DayTime manually
# Self-correct check moved to watchdog (every 5s) — no need to check every tick
scoreboard players add #daylight_counter ec.var 1
# OPT: Combined into one execute block to avoid duplicate score check
execute if score #daylight_counter ec.var matches 3.. run function evercraft:daylight/advance


# === SLEEP SKIP (advance_time is false, we handle sleep time-skip manually) ===
# Decrement cooldown
execute if score #sleep_skip_cd ec.var matches 1.. run scoreboard players remove #sleep_skip_cd ec.var 1
# OPT: sleeping_pos NBT scan every 5 ticks instead of every tick (saves ~80% of NBT reads)
# Sleep threshold is 100 ticks so 5-tick polling adds 5 per check — still accurate
scoreboard players add #sleep_poll ec.var 1
execute if score #sleep_poll ec.var matches 5.. run function evercraft:daylight/sleep_check
# After 100 ticks (5 seconds), skip to dawn
